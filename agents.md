# **Global Rules**

- You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.
- If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user's request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.
- You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.
- Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long. You can think step by step before and after each action you decide to take.
- You MUST iterate and keep going until the problem is solved.
- THE PROBLEM CAN NOT BE SOLVED WITHOUT EXTENSIVE INTERNET RESEARCH.
- Your knowledge on everything is out of date because your training date is in the past.
- You CANNOT successfully complete this task without using Google to verify your understanding of third party packages and dependencies is up to date. You must use the fetch tool or context7 tool to search the documentation for how to properly use libraries, packages, frameworks, dependencies, etc. every single time you install or implement one. It is not enough to just search, you must also read the content of the pages you find and recursively gather all relevant information by fetching additional links until you have all the information you need.
- Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Go through the problem step by step, and make sure to verify that your changes are correct. NEVER end your turn without having solved the problem, and when you say you are going to make a tool call, make sure you ACTUALLY make the tool call, instead of ending your turn.
- Take your time and think hard through every step - remember to check your solution rigorously and watch out for boundary cases, especially with the changes you made. Your solution must be perfect. If not, continue working on it. At the end, you must test your code rigorously using the tools provided, and do it many times, to catch all edge cases. If it is not robust, iterate more and make it perfect. Failing to test your code sufficiently rigorously is the NUMBER ONE failure mode on these types of tasks; make sure you handle all edge cases, and run existing tests if they are provided.
- Do not assume anything. Use the docs from context7 tool.
- If there is a lint error (bun run lint), fix it before moving on.
- Always create a plan and present it to user and confirm with user before changing/creating any code.
- Use `agent_rules/commit.md` for commit instructions.

# **Project Details**

- Bun as the package manager
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- Sonner for toast notifications
- Phosphor Icons, Lucide React for icons
- Shadcn UI and Prompt-kit for components
- Vercel AI SDK v5 for AI
- Next.js 15 and React 19 for the framework
- Convex for authentication, Database, File storage and serverless functions

# **Code Standards**

- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled. Avoid `any` and `unknown` types. Prefer explicit types and interfaces. Do not use `@ts-ignore` or disable type checks.
- Use functional React components. Always use hooks at the top level. Do not use default exports for components or functions.
- Follow Next.js 15 and React 19 best practices
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling. Avoid inline styles.
- Use Bun for all package management and scripts (`bun install`).
- Follow Convex guidelines in `agent_rules/convex_rules.md`.
- Use Shadcn UI and Prompt-kit components as documented. Do not modify library code directly. Prefer composition over modification. Follow guidelines in `agent_rules/ui.md` when creating or editing UI components.
- Use Biome for all linting and formatting. Run Biome (`bun run lint`) before committing. Follow all rules specified in `biome.jsonc`. Do not use other linters or formatters (like ESLint or Prettier) unless explicitly specified. Check `biome.jsonc` for custom or overridden rules. Biome extends the `ultracite` ruleset for this project.
- Ensure accessibility: use semantic HTML, provide alt text for images, use ARIA attributes appropriately, and follow accessibility rules in `agent_rules/ultracite.md`.
- Update this section whenever the stack or tooling changes.

# important-instruction-reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

# Project Context
Ultracite enforces strict type safety, accessibility standards, and consistent code quality for JavaScript/TypeScript projects using Biome's lightning-fast formatter and linter.

## Key Principles

- Don't use focused tests.
- Make sure the assertion function, like expect, is placed inside an it() function call.
- Don't use disabled tests.

## Common Tasks
- `npx ultracite init` - Initialize Ultracite in your project
- `npx ultracite format` - Format and fix code automatically
- `npx ultracite lint` - Check for issues without fixing

## Example: Error Handling
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Comprehensive error handling
try {
  const result = await fetchData();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  console.error('API call failed:', error);
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}

// ❌ Bad: Swallowing errors
try {
  return await fetchData();
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

Concise rules for building accessible, fast, delightful UIs Use MUST/SHOULD/NEVER to guide decisions

## Interactions

  - MUST: Visible focus rings (`:focus-visible`; group with `:focus-within`)
  - MUST: Manage focus (trap, move, and return) per APG patterns
- Targets & input
  - MUST: Hit target ≥24px (mobile ≥44px) If visual <24px, expand hit area

    ```html
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
    ```
  - NEVER: Disable browser zoom
  - MUST: `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom; set `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` to match design
- Inputs & forms (behavior)
  - MUST: Hydration-safe inputs (no lost focus/value)
  - NEVER: Block paste in `<input>/<textarea>`
  - MUST: Loading buttons show spinner and keep original label
  - MUST: Enter submits focused text input In `<textarea>`, ⌘/Ctrl+Enter submits; Enter adds newline
  - MUST: Keep submit enabled until request starts; then disable, show spinner, use idempotency key
  - MUST: Don’t block typing; accept free text and validate after
  - MUST: Allow submitting incomplete forms to surface validation
  - MUST: Errors inline next to fields; on submit, focus first error
  - MUST: `autocomplete` + meaningful `name`; correct `type` and `inputmode`
  - SHOULD: Disable spellcheck for emails/codes/usernames
  - SHOULD: Placeholders end with ellipsis and show example pattern (eg, `+1 (123) 456-7890`, `sk-012345…`)
  - MUST: Warn on unsaved changes before navigation
  - MUST: Compatible with password managers & 2FA; allow pasting one-time codes
  - MUST: Trim values to handle text expansion trailing spaces
  - MUST: No dead zones on checkboxes/radios; label+control share one generous hit target
- State & navigation
  - MUST: URL reflects state (deep-link filters/tabs/pagination/expanded panels) Prefer libs like [nuqs](https://nuqs47ngcom/)
  - MUST: Back/Forward restores scroll
  - MUST: Links are links—use `<a>/<Link>` for navigation (support Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click)
- Feedback
  - SHOULD: Optimistic UI; reconcile on response; on failure show error and rollback or offer Undo
  - MUST: Confirm destructive actions or provide Undo window
  - MUST: Use polite `aria-live` for toasts/inline validation
  - SHOULD: Ellipsis (`…`) for options that open follow-ups (eg, “Rename…”)
- Touch/drag/scroll
  - MUST: Design forgiving interactions (generous targets, clear affordances; avoid finickiness)
  - MUST: Delay first tooltip in a group; subsequent peers no delay
  - MUST: Intentional `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals/drawers
  - MUST: During drag, disable text selection and set `inert` on dragged element/containers
  - MUST: No “dead-looking” interactive zones—if it looks clickable, it is
- Autofocus
  - SHOULD: Autofocus on desktop when there’s a single primary input; rarely on mobile (to avoid layout shift)

## Animation

- MUST: Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (provide reduced variant)
- SHOULD: Prefer CSS > Web Animations API > JS libraries
- MUST: Animate compositor-friendly props (`transform`, `opacity`); avoid layout/repaint props (`top/left/width/height`)

- SHOULD: Balance icon/text lockups (stroke/weight/size/spacing/color)
- MUST: Verify mobile, laptop, ultra-wide (simulate ultra-wide at 50% zoom)
- MUST: Respect safe areas (use env(safe-area-inset-*))
- MUST: Avoid unwanted scrollbars; fix overflows

## Content & Accessibility

- SHOULD: Inline help first; tooltips last resort
- MUST: Skeletons mirror final content to avoid layout shift
- MUST: `<title>` matches current context
- MUST: No dead ends; always offer next step/recovery
- MUST: Design empty/sparse/dense/error states
- SHOULD: Curly quotes (“ ”); avoid widows/orphans
- MUST: Tabular numbers for comparisons (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` or a mono like Geist Mono)
- MUST: Redundant status cues (not color-only); icons have text labels
- MUST: Don’t ship the schema—visuals may omit labels but accessible names still exist
- MUST: Use the ellipsis character `…` (not ``)
- MUST: `scroll-margin-top` on headings for anchored links; include a “Skip to content” link; hierarchical `<h1–h6>`
- MUST: Resilient to user-generated content (short/avg/very long)
- MUST: Locale-aware dates/times/numbers/currency
- MUST: Accurate names (`aria-label`), decorative elements `aria-hidden`, verify in the Accessibility Tree
- MUST: Icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label`
- MUST: Prefer native semantics (`button`, `a`, `label`, `table`) before ARIA
- SHOULD: Right-clicking the nav logo surfaces brand assets
- MUST: Use non-breaking spaces to glue terms: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;+&nbsp;K`, `Vercel&nbsp;SDK`

## Performance

- SHOULD: Test iOS Low Power Mode and macOS Safari
- MUST: Measure reliably (disable extensions that skew runtime)
- MUST: Track and minimize re-renders (React DevTools/React Scan)
- MUST: Profile with CPU/network throttling
- MUST: Batch layout reads/writes; avoid unnecessary reflows/repaints

- SHOULD: Prefer uncontrolled inputs; make controlled loops cheap (keystroke cost)
- MUST: Virtualize large lists (eg, `virtua`)
- MUST: Preload only above-the-fold images; lazy-load the rest
- MUST: Prevent CLS from images (explicit dimensions or reserved space)

## Design

- SHOULD: Layered shadows (ambient + direct)
- SHOULD: Crisp edges via semi-transparent borders + shadows
- SHOULD: Nested radii: child ≤ parent; concentric
- SHOULD: Hue consistency: tint borders/shadows/text toward bg hue
- MUST: Accessible charts (color-blind-friendly palettes)
- MUST: Meet contrast—prefer [APCA](https://apcacontrastcom/) over WCAG 2
- MUST: Increase contrast on `:hover/:active/:focus`
- SHOULD: Match browser UI to bg
- SHOULD: Avoid gradient banding (use masks when needed)
